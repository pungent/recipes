      <ol>
        <li><br />Gather all ingredients.<br /></li>
        <li>
          <br />Make dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast
          and sugar in warm water. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to
          form a creamy foam, about 5 to 10 minutes. <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <br />
          Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away
          from the sides of the bowl.
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <br />
          Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8
          minutes.
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <br />Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth.<br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <br />
          Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; knead in
          garlic and basil. Set aside to rise for 1 more hour, or until doubled
          again.
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <br />
          Meanwhile, make garlic oil: Combine 1/2 cup olive oil with minced
          garlic in a microwave-safe cup or bowl. Heat for 30 seconds in the
          microwave.
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <br />
          Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; brush the grate with garlic
          oil.
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <br />
          Make pizzas: Punch down dough and divide in half. Form each half into
          an oblong shape 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick.
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <br />
          Carefully place one piece of dough on the hot grill. Dough will begin
          to puff almost immediately. When the bottom crust has lightly browned,
          turn dough over using two spatulas.
          <br />
        </li>
        <li><br />Working quickly, brush garlic oil over crust.<br /></li>
        <li>
          <br />
          Top with 1/2 of each of the following: tomato sauce, chopped tomatoes,
          olives, red peppers, cheese, and basil.
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <br />
          Close the lid and cook until cheese melts. Remove from grill and set
          aside to cool for a few minutes. Repeat with second piece of dough.
